## Exercise {#caseStudyExercise}

I wanted to see if [this paper](http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/9/8/792) is right in concluding that physically-fit women have lower _Eubacterium_. Here's one physically-fit woman I know and sure enough, she has none of this microbe.

Other people I've seen who _do_ have this seem to be either (1) older, or (2) on an unusual diet.
```{r}

summary(as.numeric(otu_table(people.norm)["Eubacterium"]/10000))
#kable(mhg_abundance(subset_samples(people.norm, Username == "dr2"), "Eubacterium"))

# mhg_density_for_taxa(people.norm, "Eubacterium") +
#   annotate(
#   geom = "segment",
#   color = "blue",
#   x = as.numeric(otu_table(
#   subset_samples(people.norm, Username == "dr2")
#   )["Eubacterium"]) / 10000,
#   xend = as.numeric(otu_table(
#   subset_samples(people.norm, Username == "dr2")
#   )["Eubacterium"]) / 10000 ,
#   y = 0,
#   yend = 1
#   )

```
